## Creater Notes

I initially wrote up this code in February and revisited it later in May to input newer concepts and tools I learned; namely dictionaries, for cleaner, more efficient mapping and data retrieval. This is why each function is dual-defined, for instance, we have main_old() and main_1(). Each function tagged with "_old" does not use dictionaries, and contains if-elif-else branches. 

Through this process of altering my code, I was able to better understand data structures, code refactoring, and strengthen my debugging/testing skills by comparing outputs of twin functions to ensure consistency. 

Both versions are included so you can view and compare different programming approaches.
